It includes model parameters and can also include other parameters that are used during optimization. At every round, a subset of `ServerState` is passed to the clients for federated learning. `ServerState` is also used in checkpointing and evaluation. Hence it is crucial that all the parameters that are modified during the course of federated learning are stored as part of the `ServerState`. Do not store mutable parameters as part of `fedjax.FederatedAlgorithm`.\n",
